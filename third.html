        <p><strong>The Four Core Types of Clouds are: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cirro-form</li>
            <li>Cumulo-form</li>
            <li>Strato-form</li>
            <li>Nimbo-form</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="section1.1">
            <h2>This is Section 1.1</h2>
            <p><strong>Cirro-form</strong>The Latin word <span class="special">cirro</span> means curl of hair. Composed of ice crystals, cirro-form clouds are whitish and hair-like. There are the high, wispy clouds to first appear in advance of a low-pressure area such as a mid-latitude storm system or a tropical system such as a hurricane.</p>
            <p><strong>Cumulo-form</strong>Generally detached clouds, they look like white fluffy cotton balls. They show vertical motion or thermal uplift of air taking place in the atmosphere. They are usually dense in appearance with sharp outlines. The base of cumulus clouds are generally flat and occurs at the altitude where the moisture in rising air condenses.</p>
            <p><strong>Strato-form</strong>From the Latin word for "layer", these clouds are usually broad and fairly wide spread, appearing like a blanket. They result from non-convective rising air and tend to occur along and to the north of warm fronts. The edges of strato-form clouds are diffuse.</p>
            <p><strong>Nimbo-form</strong>Howard also designated a special rain cloud category which combined the three forms cumulo + cirro + stratus. He called this cloud <span class="special">nimbus</span>, the Latin word for rain. The vast majority of precipitation occurs from nimbo-form clouds and therefore these clouds are generally the thickest.</p>
